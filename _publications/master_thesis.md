This master thesis is the result of the work carried out during my research internship at Inria in Grenoble, supervised by [Julyan Arbel](https://www.julyanarbel.com/){:target="_blank"} and 
[TÃ¢m Le Minh](https://tam-leminh.github.io/){:target="_blank"} ([Statify team](https://team.inria.fr/statify/){:target="_blank"}). Our work aimed at studying how some of the famous Bayesian Nonparametric concepts, such as the Pitman-Yor and the Dirichlet process, can be used to extend existing theory to the case of bipartite networks.

# Abstract
Many real world networks are sparse, containing relatively few connections compared to the number of possible ones. Recent developments in network theory have introduced edge exchangeable models (Cai et al., 2016; Crane and Dempsey, 2018), which are closely connected to Bayesian Nonparametrics and have been extensively studied in the unipartite setting, in which edges may connect any pair of nodes. A key advantage of these models is their ability to capture sparsity while preserving a simple yet flexible structure.

This thesis extends the edge exchangeability framework to the bipartite setting, where edges occur only between nodes belonging to two distinct groups. We propose a Bayesian Nonparametric model based on the Pitman-Yor process, and prove that, under specific conditions, it can achieve sparsity similarly to its unipartite version. Theoretical results are validated through simulation studies.

We further develop a fully Bayesian estimation procedure for the model parameters, supported by additional simulations assessing its asymptotic properties. Finally, we apply the method to a real ecological network, demonstrating how to evaluate model fit and draw conclusions from the estimation process.
