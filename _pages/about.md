I am a first year PhD student in Statistics, currently based at the University of Montpellier (IMAG). I am jointly supervised by [Gwladys Toulemonde](https://imag.umontpellier.fr/~toulemonde/index.html) and [Nicolas Meyer](https://sites.google.com/view/nicolasmeyer/accueil) from the University of Montpellier, and by [Klaus Herrmann](https://klausherrmann.github.io/) and [Éric Marchand](https://www.usherbrooke.ca/mathematiques/nous-joindre/personnel/corps-professoral/professeurs/eric-marchand) from the University of Sherbrooke.

My research topic is Extreme Value Theory (EVT), a branch of statistics that focuses on events that are extreme in magnitute and are usually far from the typical observed values. The goal of EVT is to develop models able to quantify the risk associated to extreme events, making it central in many applied fields, such as hydrology, finance and insurance.
